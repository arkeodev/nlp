        "The `PositionalEncoding` class is a component designed to add information about the position of tokens within a sequence to the embeddings in a Transformer model. Since the Transformer architecture relies on attention mechanisms that do not inherently understand sequence order (unlike RNNs or LSTMs), positional encodings are crucial for enabling the model to consider the order of tokens when processing text or other sequential data. Without them, the model would treat sequences as unordered sets of tokens, significantly reducing its ability to perform tasks that rely on the sequential nature of the data, such as language understanding, translation, and generation.\n",

        "    - **pe (Positional Encoding Matrix)**: A precomputed matrix where each row represents the positional encoding for a specific position in a sequence. The encodings alternate between sine and cosine functions across different dimensions, allowing the model to distinguish positions based on these patterns. The use of sine and cosine functions helps the model to learn to attend to relative positions since the encoding for a position is a function of its distance from other positions.\n",
