# NLP Notebook Repository

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), starting with our inaugural notebook, "Transformers from Scratch." NLP is a crucial subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language, facilitating seamless human-computer interactions. This repository aims to cover a wide range of NLP topics, from foundational algorithms to advanced models like transformers, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and techniques for fine-tuning models for specific applications.

## What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural Language Processing combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. These approaches enable computers to process and understand human (natural) languages, making it possible to execute tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and topic extraction. NLP technologies are behind the scenes of many applications we use daily, such as virtual assistants, chatbots, and language translation services.

## Repository Contents
### Decoding_Algorithms

- **Decoding Algorithms in NLP**: A Jupyter notebook that delves into the decoding strategies used in natural language processing. It covers Greedy, Beam Search, Pure Sampling, Top-K Sampling, and Top-P (Nucleus) Sampling methods, providing a mix of theoretical background, code implementations, and visual examples to demonstrate each decoding technique's impact on text generation.

- **Understanding Positional Encoding**: This notebook provides an in-depth look at positional encoding mechanisms and their significance in language models, particularly in Transformers. It delves into Sinusodial Positional Encodings, Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) methods.

- **Embeddings**: This section explores the transformative world of embeddings in natural language processing, detailing both word-based and context-based embedding models. Through practical examples and code snippets, it elucidates how embeddings capture semantic and syntactic nuances of language, significantly enhancing the machine's understanding of text.

- **Tokenisation**: A Jupyter notebook that explores the fundamentals of tokenization in NLP, addressing its critical role in preprocessing textual data, overcoming multilingual challenges, various tokenization techniques, and practical applications.

- **Transformers from Scratch (DRAFT)**: A detailed Jupyter notebook that introduces the concept, architecture, and implementation of transformer models from the ground up. This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to understand the workings of one of the most influential models in modern NLP.

### Coming Soon

- **Fine Tuning**: A guide on how to fine-tune pre-trained models on domain-specific tasks for improved performance.
- And more topics that delve deeper into the vast field of NLP.
