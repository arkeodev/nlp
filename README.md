# NLP Notebook Repository

## Overview

THIS repository dedicated to exploring and implementing various techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). From foundational concepts to advanced methodologies, this collection aims to provide an in-depth understanding and practical experience in NLP. The notebooks cover a range of topics including transformer models, tokenization, machine translation, and fine-tuning techniques, making this a comprehensive resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field.

## Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLM's)

Natural Language Processing is a pivotal subfield of artificial intelligence focused on enabling interactions between computers and humans through natural language. Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language by processing vast amounts of textual data, enabling applications from automated content creation to sophisticated conversational interfaces. Our notebooks are meticulously crafted to guide you through the intricate details of various NLP and Large Language Modelsâ€”from foundational concepts in transformer architectures to sophisticated techniques like fine-tuning and neural machine translation.
