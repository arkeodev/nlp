While they were somewhat effective for languages with similar structures, their performance dropped significantly with complex or unrelated language pairs.\n",

SMT models used statistical methods to translate text based on the probability distributions of words and phrases, learned from large corpora of translated texts. This method was more flexible and scalable than RBMT, but still struggled with syntactic and semantic nuances, often producing literal translations that lacked contextual coherence."

This method was simple but had major limitations, such as high dimensionality and an inability to capture semantic relationships between words.\n",

Techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe allowed words to be represented as dense vectors where semantically similar words were mapped to proximate points in vector space. These embeddings were pre-trained on large corpora and could then be used to initialize the first layer of neural networks in NMT systems, providing a richer and more expressive input representation."

This allowed the embeddings to be optimized specifically for the translation task, rather than relying solely on pre-trained embeddings. This integration led to further improvements in translation quality by tailoring the embeddings to capture nuances specific to the languages and textual contexts involved in the translation tasks."

        "2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: The true breakthrough came with the application of RNNs, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which could remember long sequences of words—crucial for maintaining context in sentences. The encoder-decoder architecture, where one RNN encoded the input sentence into a context vector and another RNN decoded this vector into a translation, became a foundational model for NMT."
