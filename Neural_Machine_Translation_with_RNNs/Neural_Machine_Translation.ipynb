Unlike traditional neural networks that assume all inputs (and outputs) are independent of each other, sequence networks are adept at managing data where the order is significant, such as time series data, sentences in natural language processing, or steps in a video. These networks can capture temporal dynamics and relationships within the data, allowing them to perform tasks like predicting the next word in a sentence, generating text, understanding spoken language, or forecasting time-dependent variables. The adaptability of sequence networks to various input-output mappings—such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many—makes them extraordinarily versatile and powerful for a wide range of sequential processing tasks in machine learning.\n","\n","Here is the Sequence Network Types:\n","\n","- **One to One**: This type of network has a single input and produces a single output. It is the simplest form of sequence modeling and is not typically used for sequences. An example task would be a traditional neural network that maps one input to one output, like a simple regression.\n","\n","- **One to Many**: This network takes a single input and produces a sequence of outputs. It is useful for tasks where one piece of information can lead to a sequence of results. An example task would be image captioning, where an image input results in a sequence of words forming the caption.\n","\n","- **Many to One**: Here, a sequence of inputs leads to a single output. This is often used for tasks where the entire sequence is necessary to produce a meaningful result. An example task would be sentiment analysis, where a sequence of words (a sentence or document) is classified as expressing a positive or negative sentiment.\n","\n","- **Many to Many (synced)**: This type of network processes a sequence of inputs and produces a sequence of outputs where the output is generated synchronously with the input. This is often used in tasks where each time step in the input is directly related to a time step in the output. An example task would be video frame prediction, where each input frame corresponds to an output prediction.\n","\n","- **Many to Many (asynced)**: This network type processes a sequence of inputs and produces a sequence of outputs, but the outputs are not synchronously produced with the inputs. This can be used in tasks where a sequence is processed before the output sequence is generated. An example task would be machine translation, where an entire sentence must be read before the translation can begin."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sBkMr1YaZNJU"},"source":["## Impact on Language Processing"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9QVzwT7QZNJU"},"source":["The advent of Sequence networks and the NMT has notably impacted the field of language processing by introducing several key capabilities:\n","\n","- **Handling of Idiomatic Expressions**: Traditional models often struggled with idioms and culturally specific phrases.

This speed is crucial for applications requiring real-time translation.\n","\n","- **Improved Scalability**: Given the right computational resources, NMT models can be scaled to accommodate large-scale translation tasks that were previously impractical, making it feasible to offer high-quality translation services on a global scale.\n","\n","- **Accessibility**: By lowering language barriers, NMT increases accessibility, allowing more people to access content in their native or preferred languages.

These systems required extensive manual work to define grammatical structures and vocabulary mappings between the source and target languages. While they were somewhat effective for languages with similar structures, their performance dropped significantly with complex or unrelated language pairs.\n","\n","2. **Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)**: Emerging in the late 1980s and coming into prominence in the 1990s, SMT represented a shift towards data-driven approaches. SMT models used statistical methods to translate text based on the probability distributions of words and phrases, learned from large corpora of translated texts. This method was more flexible and scalable than RBMT, but still struggled with syntactic and semantic nuances, often producing literal translations that lacked contextual coherence."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"X5nRahUvZNJW"},"source":["### The Role of Embeddings in NMT Evolution"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3qoH6gZXZNJX"},"source":["#### Introduction to Word Embeddings"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0UdN_ZlbZNJX"},"source":["Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meanings to have a similar representation.

Each word in the vocabulary was represented by a vector where only one element is one, and all others are zero. This method was simple but had major limitations, such as high dimensionality and an inability to capture semantic relationships between words.\n","\n","2. **Distributed Representations (Word2Vec, GloVe)**: The shift to distributed representations marked a significant improvement. Techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe allowed words to be represented as dense vectors where semantically similar words were mapped to proximate points in vector space. These embeddings were pre-trained on large corpora and could then be used to initialize the first layer of neural networks in NMT systems, providing a richer and more expressive input representation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CeOP0vH3ZNJX"},"source":["#### Embeddings in NMT"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"t8p0GgN5ZNJX"},"source":["1. **Improved Semantic Capture**: Embeddings provided a way for models to grasp semantic meanings and relationships, which are crucial for accurate translation.

This scalability was essential as NMT models began to be applied to larger and more complex language pairs and datasets.\n","\n","3. **Custom Embeddings for NMT**: As NMT systems evolved, researchers started training custom embeddings as part of the end-to-end training process of the translation model. This allowed the embeddings to be optimized specifically for the translation task, rather than relying solely on pre-trained embeddings. This integration led to further improvements in translation quality by tailoring the embeddings to capture nuances specific to the languages and textual contexts involved in the translation tasks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"p10JwQaxZNJY"},"source":["#### Continuous Improvement with Contextual Embeddings"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VBP6fpBPZNJY"},"source":["With the arrival of models like ELMo and later BERT, the concept of embeddings expanded from static representations to contextual embeddings.

The encoder-decoder architecture, where one RNN encoded the input sentence into a context vector and another RNN decoded this vector into a translation, became a foundational model for NMT."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<figure>\n","    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arkeodev/nlp/main/Neural_Machine_Translation_with_RNNs/images/neural_machine_translation.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Neural Machine Translation\">\n","    <figcaption>Neural Machine Translation</figcaption>\n","</figure>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oae3U4x8ZNJY"},"source":["### Advancements and Modern Architectures"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8Olkw7tvZNJY"},"source":["\n","1. **Attention Mechanisms**: The introduction of attention mechanisms was a pivotal improvement in NMT. It allowed the model to focus on different parts of the input sentence while translating, mimicking how human translators revisit different words and phrases. This led to translations that were not only more fluent but also more accurate in terms of context and semantics.\n","\n","2. **Transformers and Self-Attention**: The development of the Transformer model in 2017 marked the next significant evolution. Transformers replaced recurrence with self-attention layers, which process all words in the sentence simultaneously. This parallel processing significantly increased the speed and efficiency of training and improved the handling of long-range dependencies in text, setting new standards for translation quality.\n","\n","3. **Integration of BERT and Pre-trained Models**: Following the success of Transformers, the use of bidirectional and pre-trained models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) further pushed the boundaries. These models, pre-trained on vast amounts of text before being fine-tuned for translation, brought improvements in understanding contextual nuances and generative capabilities.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bP_Mle8mZNJZ"},"source":["## Implementation of NMT"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TFHDkd_wZNJZ"},"source":["### Setting Up the Environment"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":117,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-22T19:48:11.909896Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-22T19:48:11.909585Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-22T19:48:27.162954Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-22T19:48:27.161848Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-22T19:48:11.909859Z"},"id":"opc9RwgsZNJZ","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import necessary libraries\n","import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence\n","from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset\n","\n","import torchtext\n","from torchtext.data.utils import get_tokenizer\n","from torchtext.vocab import build_vocab_from_iterator\n","\n","from pathlib import Path\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","import spacy"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KQ1iiYeRZNJb"},"source":["### Data Preparation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"n4cEANKcZNJb"},"source":["#### Downloading the Dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":119,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-22T19:48:27.164875Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-22T19:48:27.164253Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-22T19:48:29.901014Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-22T19:48:29.900088Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-22T19:48:27.164839Z"},"id":"Bz5_cKnEZNJb","outputId":"c19fa3ab-c19d-48e3-9438-293da98299dc","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["--2024-04-23 12:39:05--  https://www.manythings.org/anki/fra-eng.zip\n","Resolving www.manythings.org (www.manythings.org)... 173.254.30.110\n","Connecting to www.manythings.org (www.manythings.org)|173.254.30.110|:443...
