The architecture was designed to capture the nuances of language, predicting the probability distribution of words across a vast vocabulary."

This simplification meant that, without the complexities of a full neural network, the model might not capture data representations as precisely with smaller datasets.

Moreover, this streamlined model significantly reduced complexity, enabling the processing of larger datasets with greater efficiency.\n",
